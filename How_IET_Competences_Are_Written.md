# 🧱 How IET Competences Are Written – Using STAR and SMART

This guide explains how to write high-quality engineering competence evidence aligned with the IET and UK-SPEC using the STAR and SMART techniques.

## 🔹 The STAR Technique

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Situation** | Set the scene (organisation, challenge, project) |
| **Task** | What was your responsibility? What were the objectives? |
| **Action** | What did YOU do? (Focus on verbs: led, developed, solved, created) |
| **Result** | What was the measurable impact or outcome? |

## 🔸 The SMART Approach

| Criterion | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Specific** | Clearly identify what you did and why |
| **Measurable** | Use metrics, timeframes, percentages where possible |
| **Achievable** | The action must be realistic and completed by you |
| **Relevant** | Directly relate to IET's competence |
| **Time-bound** | Anchor it to a timeframe, deadline, or duration |

## ✅ Writing Tips

- Always write in **first person** (“I was responsible for…”)
- Focus on **your unique contribution**, not the team
- Include **technical details** where needed
- Keep responses **concise but rich in evidence**
- Cross-reference competences if one example supports multiple areas

Use this framework to self-assess your own evidence or mentor others.
