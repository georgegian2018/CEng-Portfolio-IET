### ✅ **Alternate E5 – Demonstrate Professionalism, Integrity and Commitment to Engineering**

**Theme:** Mentoring, Membership, and Public Engagement

**Situation:**

Throughout my career, I’ve sought to uphold the values of professionalism, integrity, and public service within the engineering community. In 2022, I formalised this commitment by becoming a mentor for early-career engineers and increasing my involvement in professional networks.

**Task:**

My goals were to support emerging professionals, contribute to the public understanding of engineering, and represent the values of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) through visible leadership.

**Action:**

I enrolled as a volunteer mentor in my company’s graduate development scheme, providing monthly guidance on ethics, technical growth, and communication skills. I also delivered guest lectures at a local university on smart buildings and career pathways in engineering.

I actively contributed to IET local network events and published two thought-leadership blogs on sustainability and digital integration in engineering systems. I uphold the IET Code of Conduct and regularly reflect on it during project work and mentoring sessions.

**Result:**

Two of my mentees successfully progressed toward their professional registration applications. I was invited to join a local IET committee and was recognised internally as a role model for ethical and professional behaviour. This sustained involvement illustrates my integrity, leadership, and commitment to the development of others and the profession as a whole.
