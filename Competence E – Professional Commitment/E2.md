### ✅ **Alternate E2 – Responsibility for Health, Safety and Welfare**

**Theme:** Site Safety Leadership on a Retrofit Project

**Situation:**

In 2022, I was assigned to oversee the installation of AV systems within a live, operational hospital in Riyadh. The retrofit posed several safety challenges: infection control zones, patient proximity, electrical safety, and multiple overlapping trades in confined spaces.

**Task:**

As the lead engineer, I was responsible for ensuring our subcontractors and staff worked safely within medical environments, met hospital health protocols, and followed both local and international HSE standards.

**Action:**

I carried out a full site risk assessment aligned with OSHA and NFPA 99 healthcare electrical safety codes. I introduced a permit-to-work system in collaboration with hospital facilities and coordinated daily toolbox talks with subcontractors on infection prevention.

I mandated that all tools be battery-powered (no trailing cables), and that installation times be coordinated to avoid high-traffic patient zones. I also enforced PPE use and initiated a “stop work” policy empowering workers to pause activities for any safety concern.

**Result:**

The retrofit was completed without a single incident or safety violation. Our team received formal appreciation from the hospital’s safety officer for professionalism in a live clinical environment. This reinforced my commitment to health, safety, and welfare in all engineering operations.
