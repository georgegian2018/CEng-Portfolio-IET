### ✅ **Alternate E3 – Undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD)**

**Theme:** Transitioning to Cyber-Physical Systems

**Situation:**

As AV and building systems began merging with IT and IP-based solutions, I recognised a skills gap in my understanding of cyber-physical systems (CPS), network protocols, and Industry 4.0 trends. I decided to build my knowledge to support my clients’ evolving needs.

**Task:**

Over a 2-year period, I designed a structured CPD plan to expand my knowledge of OT (Operational Technology), IoT (Internet of Things), cybersecurity in building systems, and digital twin concepts. I aimed to gain both theoretical insight and practical project application.

**Action:**

I completed vendor certifications with Cisco (CCNA), Bosch Video IP Systems, and Tridium Niagara. I also joined ASHRAE’s Smart Building Systems committee to stay informed of trends.

To apply this knowledge, I volunteered to lead the integration of a building analytics platform on a mixed-use development in Kuwait. I implemented fault detection logic using BACnet data streams and MQTT protocols. I reflected on each project through internal knowledge-sharing sessions and built a library of lessons learned for my team.

**Result:**

My enhanced CPS knowledge enabled me to deliver two smart building deployments with cloud-native diagnostics and remote tuning. Clients specifically requested me for future projects due to my hybrid skill set. This ongoing CPD commitment demonstrates how I’ve proactively developed to remain relevant and lead in emerging areas of engineering.
