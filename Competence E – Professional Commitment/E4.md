✅ Alternate E4 – Exercise Responsibility for Environmental and Sustainability Issues

Theme: Net-Zero Carbon Design for School Expansion

Situation:
In 2021, I worked on a private school expansion in the UAE that had committed to achieving net-zero operational carbon emissions by 2030. I was responsible for the AV and ICT scope but was also a sustainability champion in the multidisciplinary design team.

Task:
My role included reviewing our technical design for sustainability impacts, reducing embodied carbon in AV/ICT systems, and promoting circular economy principles within the supply chain.

Action:
I reviewed the embodied carbon metrics of AV racks, displays, and cabling using Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). I selected modular AV control systems to enable long-term reconfiguration, reducing future landfill waste. I worked with procurement to prioritise products with eco-labels and RoHS compliance.

I also coordinated with the electrical team to ensure our AV systems supported automated energy management—such as occupancy-based shutoff logic and daylight-linked brightness settings.

To promote sustainability awareness, I presented to our team on “Green AV” practices and helped draft a guide on ICT sustainability for the client’s facilities team.

Result:
Our design achieved LEED Gold certification and projected energy use was reduced by 17% due to integrated control strategies. My sustainability leadership was acknowledged in the final project review, and I was invited to advise on the client’s broader decarbonisation roadmap. This project demonstrated my commitment to sustainable engineering aligned with global and local goals.
