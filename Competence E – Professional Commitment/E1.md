### ✅ **Alternate E1 – Apply Professional and Ethical Conduct**

**Theme:** Vendor Selection Ethics in a Government Tender

**Situation:**

In 2020, I was part of a technical advisory team on a government tender for a new data centre infrastructure in the GCC region. I was involved in preparing bid evaluation criteria and reviewing vendor submissions for fairness and compliance.

**Task:**

As part of the technical evaluation committee, I had to ensure all assessments remained impartial, confidential, and aligned with the procurement code of ethics. One vendor attempted to privately influence the outcome by offering "early delivery guarantees" outside the formal bid process.

**Action:**

I reported the offer to the procurement authority and excused myself from evaluating that specific vendor to avoid conflict of interest. I referenced the IET Code of Conduct and ensured all future interactions were handled exclusively via the formal channel.

I helped revise the RFP documentation to include a clearer clause prohibiting unauthorised communication. I also briefed junior evaluators on ethical red flags and guided them through objective scoring based solely on submitted documentation and compliance with technical standards.

**Result:**

The tender evaluation concluded without issue, and the client thanked our team for preserving fairness and transparency. The ethical handling of the incident strengthened our relationship with the Ministry. This example demonstrates how I apply professional integrity and ethics in line with IET’s expectations for Chartered Engineers.
