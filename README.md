Welcome to my professional portfolio supporting my application for **Chartered Engineer (CEng)** registration with the **Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)**.

This repository is designed to be used **both as a GitHub repository and as a GitHub Wiki**, providing clear, structured evidence against the **UK-SPEC competence framework (A–E)**.

---
This repository provides practical guidance on how to write IET professional registration competences using the official UK-SPEC framework.

It demonstrates how to structure competence evidence clearly and effectively by combining:
- The **Situation, Task, Action, Result** technique **(STAR)**, and
- The **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound** objectives **(SMART)**.

The material is suitable for applicants and mentors supporting:
- Chartered Engineer (CEng)
- Incorporated Engineer (IEng)
- Engineering Technician (EngTech)
- Information and Communications Technology Technician (ICTTech)

All examples are written in line with IET assessor expectations and focus on:
- First-person (“I”) evidence,
- Measurable outcomes,
- Professional responsibility and impact.
