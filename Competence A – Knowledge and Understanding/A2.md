✅ Alternate A2 – Developing Technological Solutions to Complex Problems

Theme: Command & Control Room for Emergency Services

Situation:
In 2020, I worked as a Senior Technology Consultant on a government-led Emergency Services Coordination Centre project. The facility was designed to integrate police, fire, and ambulance dispatch in one command room for real-time crisis response. I was brought in to solve multiple challenges relating to latency, system interoperability, and redundancy in mission-critical communications.

Task:
My responsibility over six months was to design and deploy a resilient AV and control system that enabled live collaboration across agencies using multiple video feeds, GIS mapping, and incident tracking. The key challenge was ensuring real-time performance and system failover in a high-risk, always-on environment. I had to develop a solution that could function without disruption in the event of hardware failure or network degradation.

Action:
I carried out a deep-dive technical risk assessment and benchmarked systems against ISO 22301 for business continuity. I designed a redundant architecture using a dual-network topology, virtualised control processors, and real-time KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) switches with fibre uplinks. I also introduced active monitoring systems for early fault detection using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) traps.

To validate the design under simulated failure, I conducted a live failover test, which involved intentionally disconnecting key equipment during simulated operations to ensure seamless continuity. I trained operators on these failure modes and documented the full system handover with visual schematics and test logs. I also worked with vendors to ensure power supplies, ventilation, and firmware updates complied with their respective MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) metrics.

Result:
The system was delivered on time and passed all resilience and interoperability tests with zero critical failures. During a real flood emergency four months later, the facility operated continuously with no downtime, and I was formally recognised in the project’s post-incident report. This experience demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to high-risk technical challenges and deliver engineered systems that are robust, resilient, and fully fit for critical use.
