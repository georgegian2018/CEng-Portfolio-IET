### ✅ **Alternate A1 – Maintaining and Extending a Theoretical Approach**

**Theme:** Broadcast Control Room Systems Integration

**Situation:**

In 2017, I joined a national television network as a Systems Engineer, where I was tasked with modernising the main broadcast control room infrastructure. The facility had legacy SDI (Serial Digital Interface)-based systems with limited capacity for high-definition or IP-based workflows. As I had recently completed a postgraduate module on Digital Video Signal Processing, this project gave me the opportunity to apply and deepen my academic learning within a fast-evolving industry environment.

**Task:**

Over four months, I was assigned full responsibility for designing and implementing an upgraded signal routing and monitoring system. The new system needed to support 4K video workflows, integrate with IP-based ingest and playout systems, and comply with SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) standards for media transport over IP. I also needed to justify all design decisions based on sound engineering theory and industry best practice.

**Action:**

I began by reviewing the latest SMPTE ST 2110 standards for professional media over IP and modelled the signal paths using MATLAB to simulate latency, jitter, and bandwidth loads. I created a network design using Layer 3 switches with Precision Time Protocol (PTP) for frame alignment, referencing guidelines from the Video Services Forum. I conducted risk assessments for signal loss and timing errors, and implemented redundancy with dual NICs and failover paths.

To validate my theoretical approach, I liaised with vendors including Grass Valley and Evertz, analysed their white papers, and participated in industry webinars. I also authored technical documentation explaining the signal timing model, IP multicast routing, and failover logic to support future maintenance and audits.

**Result:**

The system was commissioned successfully, enabling seamless 4K playout with improved reliability and real-time diagnostics. The engineering director commended the clarity of my technical design and documentation, which became the blueprint for similar upgrades across regional sites. This experience reinforced my theoretical knowledge of digital media and IP-based transport, contributed to my Continuing Professional Development (CPD), and demonstrated how I apply and extend a sound theoretical base to deliver reliable, standards-driven solutions in my role.
