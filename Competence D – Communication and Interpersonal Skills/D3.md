### ✅ **Alternate D3 – Social, Cultural, Diversity and Inclusion Awareness**

**Theme:** Inclusive Design on an Educational Campus Project

**Situation:**

In 2021, I was assigned to a major university expansion project in Doha, Qatar, serving as AV and ICT systems coordinator. The client had a clear mandate to ensure accessibility and inclusivity across all facilities, as the campus would host students and faculty from over 30 nationalities, including those with hearing, visual, or mobility impairments.

**Task:**

My task was to ensure the AV systems—classrooms, auditoriums, and wayfinding displays—met the client's diversity and accessibility goals. This involved embedding inclusive design features, accommodating cultural expectations, and ensuring universal usability across all AV touchpoints.

**Action:**

I studied the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and BS 8300 standards, and conducted benchmarking using case studies from other inclusive universities. I ensured induction loop systems were incorporated in all large venues for hearing-impaired users and worked with the interface designers to include high-contrast text, tactile buttons, and multilingual audio guides.

I facilitated a workshop with the university’s accessibility advisor and disability rights group to gather feedback on control interfaces and signage placements. I collaborated with the interior design team to ensure system controls were mounted at accessible heights and interfaces could toggle between Arabic and English.

I also worked with the project managers to conduct cultural sensitivity briefings for vendors—highlighting key social expectations such as gender-separated areas and appropriate content display.

**Result:**

All AV systems passed accessibility audits during commissioning. The university received recognition from a regional disability advocacy group, and our inclusive design documentation was published internally as a design best practice. This experience reinforced my awareness of social, cultural, and accessibility factors and how to incorporate them proactively into engineering solutions.
