### ✅ **Alternate D2 – Present and Justify Proposals and Conclusions**



**Theme:** Nationwide Retail Bank ICT Upgrade



**Situation:**

In 2023, I worked as Principal Consultant on a multi-branch ICT upgrade project for a leading retail bank in Saudi Arabia. The scope included Wi-Fi 6 access points, digital signage, and high-availability structured cabling designs for 40 locations. The bank’s leadership was cost-sensitive and risk-averse due to a recent service disruption caused by a network failure.



**Task:**

Over a 2-month design window, I was responsible for preparing and defending the technical strategy, design options, and cost-benefit analysis to both engineering and executive teams. My proposals needed to demonstrate resilience, scalability, and alignment with international standards.



**Action:**

I conducted a full site assessment across four representative branches to gather baseline network performance metrics. I developed two design options: a low-cost version with incremental upgrades and a high-availability design with full redundancy. I presented both to the client with detailed TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) models, uptime risk calculations, and compliance summaries.



During presentations, I used dashboards, failure scenarios, and visual signal flow diagrams to explain the differences. I answered detailed questions from the CIO and Head of Security, using international benchmarks such as TIA-942 and BICSI to support our conclusions.



To align the decision-making process, I documented all assumptions, constraints, and vendor dependencies. I also created a proposal summary document tailored for non-technical senior leadership to approve funding.



**Result:**

The client selected the high-availability design based on our transparent justifications. The proposal was approved without further revisions, and I was assigned to lead the implementation. The bank later reported a 40% decrease in downtime-related complaints. This confirmed my ability to clearly present and justify engineering strategies that align technical and commercial outcomes.
