### ✅ **Alternate C1 – Planning Work and Resources for a Major Project**

**Theme:** Data Centre Migration Planning for Global Bank

**Situation:**

In 2023, I served as Lead Infrastructure Engineer on a global data centre migration project for a multinational bank consolidating operations across three continents. The existing setup involved fragmented legacy systems with high energy costs and inconsistent performance.

**Task:**

My task over a 6-week planning phase was to lead the technical planning and resource allocation for migrating over 600 virtual machines and storage clusters to a new Tier IV facility. This involved coordinating across multiple time zones, managing dependencies, and ensuring no service downtime for critical banking operations.

**Action:**

I began by holding discovery sessions with application owners to catalogue systems, dependencies, and risk levels. I grouped workloads into migration “waves” based on risk, performance, and location.

I developed a resource matrix covering network engineers, database admins, cloud architects, and support staff, then aligned this with a phased migration timeline. I used Microsoft Project to visualise dependencies and delivery gates and led daily stand-ups to identify blockers.

To mitigate operational risk, I scheduled test migrations in sandbox environments and allocated buffer time for post-migration verification. I produced detailed runbooks for each wave, ensuring repeatable processes.

**Result:**

All three regional data centres were successfully decommissioned, and the new system went live without service disruption. The project reduced infrastructure costs by 35% and improved application latency by 20%. The client’s CIO praised our planning accuracy and reuse of resources across phases. This demonstrated my ability to plan large-scale engineering efforts, allocate resources effectively, and lead teams through complex transitions with precision and clarity.
