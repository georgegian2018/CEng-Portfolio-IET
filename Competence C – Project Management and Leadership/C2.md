✅ Alternate C2 – Managing Schedule, Budget, and Resources

Theme: University Smart Campus Infrastructure Rollout

Situation:
In 2023, I was appointed Project Lead for a university smart campus initiative involving the integration of smart lighting, energy metering, and room booking systems across 12 academic buildings. The project had a fixed budget, tight academic calendar deadlines, and multiple third-party suppliers involved.

Task:
Over a two-month delivery window, I was responsible for managing all budget, schedule, and resource aspects of the engineering rollout. This included procurement, subcontractor coordination, and risk mitigation across electrical, IT, and commissioning teams.

Action:
I used MS Project and Power BI to build a live work breakdown structure (WBS) aligned with academic shutdown windows. I forecasted man-hours, tracked delivery lead times, and allocated engineering teams to parallel task clusters based on building access windows.

To manage the £600,000 budget, I tracked real-time costs against allocated packages using financial dashboards. When supplier lead times changed, I created contingency scenarios and re-prioritised the commissioning sequence. I also conducted weekly status meetings with university stakeholders and used RAID logs (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) to maintain transparency.

I ensured fair but efficient task allocation across teams to prevent fatigue and underutilisation. When one supplier failed a FAT (Factory Acceptance Test), I applied penalty clauses and initiated a backup vendor without delaying the milestone.

Result:
All systems were installed, tested, and operational before the semester began. Final project costs came within 3% of the approved budget, with 100% milestone delivery on schedule. The Vice Chancellor acknowledged the delivery team publicly, and I was assigned to oversee the next smart library expansion. This project showcased my ability to control multiple project dimensions and deliver large-scale engineering work within tight timelines and financial constraints.
