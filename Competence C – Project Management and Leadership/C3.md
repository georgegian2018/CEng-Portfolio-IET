### ✅ **Alternate C3 – Leading Teams and Assisting Others**

**Theme:** Nationwide 5G Tower Rollout Coordination

**Situation:**

In 2022, I was hired by a telecoms infrastructure provider as a Senior Delivery Engineer during a national 5G network expansion programme. The company was rolling out over 180 towers in metropolitan and remote regions across six months. My responsibility was to lead a team of field engineers, support junior colleagues, and streamline delivery across three regions.

**Task:**

I was assigned to lead deployment in the Northern cluster (50 towers), which included dense city zones and rural communities. The technical scope included civil, RF (Radio Frequency), and fibre connectivity works. I had to manage changing site conditions, coordinate with multiple municipalities, and support junior engineers with limited telecoms field experience.

**Action:**

I developed a rollout playbook to standardise site assessment, risk evaluation, and handover protocols. I mentored new field engineers by conducting hands-on workshops covering tower grounding, antenna alignment, and safety compliance. I created daily dispatch schedules and used GIS (Geographic Information Systems) dashboards to track live site progress.

I also chaired bi-weekly team retrospectives, identifying common delays and proposing fixes—such as bulk permitting requests and multi-supplier kits—to reduce idle time. I acted as the interface between subcontractors, RF planners, and the central programme office to ensure technical alignment.

To raise engineering standards, I introduced peer design reviews and post-installation audits, and I rewarded high performers with internal recognition points, increasing team morale.

**Result:**

My team completed the rollout with 100% site acceptance and 2 weeks ahead of the cluster schedule. Field engineers under my mentorship independently led their own sites within 3 months. Senior management praised our coordination model and used it to replicate success in other regions. This experience demonstrated my ability to lead diverse engineering teams while building capability and adapting to dynamic, multi-stakeholder technical environments.
