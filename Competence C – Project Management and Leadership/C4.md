### ✅ **Alternate C4 – Promote Quality Improvement and Best Practice**



**Theme:** ICT Infrastructure Design for National Public Hospital



**Situation:**

In 2021, I was appointed ICT Systems Lead for a 400-bed national public hospital project in Bahrain. The Ministry of Health had mandated that the new facility align with Joint Commission International (JCI) healthcare standards and meet ISO 9001 quality expectations. The challenge was to establish ICT quality practices during a period of overlapping design changes, tight deadlines, and limited local expertise.



**Task:**

Over a 10-month period, I had to ensure all ICT design packages—including nurse call, security, AV, and structured cabling—were delivered with traceable, auditable quality processes. I also had to embed best practices across our engineering team and help upskill junior team members to support long-term quality outcomes.



**Action:**

I established a project-specific quality plan aligned with ISO 9001, defining approval workflows, peer reviews, version control, and deviation protocols. I used a centralised cloud documentation system with naming conventions to prevent confusion between multiple design iterations.



I conducted weekly quality review meetings with discipline leads and introduced technical trackers for each system package. I shared international best practices from previous hospital projects and used lessons-learned logs to guide design decisions and flag risks.



I created a “common non-compliance” library to improve drawing checks and reduce repetitive QA flags. I also hosted a monthly knowledge-sharing session to cross-train AV, security, and telecom engineers on integration points and standards.



**Result:**

The ICT documentation passed the first formal QA audit with zero NCRs (non-conformance reports), and the Ministry commended our detailed interface design. My quality framework was later adapted by the contractor’s MEP team as their standard for documentation. The junior engineers I trained became QA leads for subsequent phases. This experience strengthened my role in promoting quality culture, institutionalising good engineering habits, and ensuring ISO-aligned outputs across disciplines.
