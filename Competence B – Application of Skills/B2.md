✅ Alternate B2 – Identifying and Conducting Investigations and Research

Theme: Urban Traffic Management System Upgrade

Situation:
In 2021, I worked as a Senior Systems Engineer at a smart city consultancy. I was assigned to a large-scale urban traffic management project in a capital city aiming to reduce congestion and emissions. My role was to design the upgrade of 25 key intersections to support adaptive traffic control using vehicle detection, AI analytics, and V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication.

Task:
I had to identify the right research, field tests, and technical investigations to evaluate and select the most appropriate detection technologies (e.g. radar, LIDAR, computer vision), network infrastructure, and platform compatibility with the city's existing SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System). The technologies were unfamiliar to the client, and the design required integration across multiple agencies.

Action:
I began by performing a comparative study of sensor types, using vendor white papers and independent evaluations to shortlist radar and computer vision systems. I conducted site visits and used traffic simulation software (PTV Vissim) to model queue lengths and intersection efficiency. I organised two real-world pilot installations to test latency and accuracy under adverse weather conditions.

To ensure system interoperability, I reviewed the SCATS protocol specifications and commissioned an API compatibility test with our shortlisted suppliers. I also evaluated fibre and wireless backhaul options by analysing latency, signal interference, and power constraints.

I documented my findings and compiled a technical evaluation report ranking the solutions against SMART criteria: accuracy >95%, latency <2 seconds, compliance with EN 50126 standards, and a 3-year ROI window.

Result:
Based on my research, the city chose a radar-based solution integrated with a cloud-hosted analytics platform. My investigations directly influenced the procurement decision, which was approved by both the city council and transport ministry. The trial intersections saw a 22% reduction in average delay time. This experience strengthened my ability to identify and carry out applied research that supports critical engineering design decisions across complex, multi-stakeholder environments.
