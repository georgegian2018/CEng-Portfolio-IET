### ✅ **Alternate B3 – Implementing and Evaluating Engineering Solutions**

**Theme:** Renewable Energy Microgrid in Remote Community

**Situation:**

In 2022, I led a multidisciplinary team as part of a government-sponsored project to implement a solar-diesel microgrid for a remote village in East Africa. The community faced regular outages due to unstable supply from the national grid. The project aimed to implement a hybrid system to reduce reliance on diesel and improve uptime.

**Task:**

I was responsible for implementing the full electrical, communications, and control system, and evaluating its effectiveness once commissioned. Given the remote location and limited technical skills available locally, the system needed to be robust, autonomous, and easy to maintain.

**Action:**

I designed a 75kW solar PV system with battery storage and integrated it with existing diesel gensets using a hybrid inverter platform. I deployed a local Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system with GSM remote access for monitoring.

During implementation, I trained local technicians using visual manuals and ran live fault simulations to assess response readiness. I applied ISO 50001 energy management principles to monitor power quality, frequency stability, and solar utilisation rates.

After installation, I conducted a 3-month evaluation period and analysed system performance data. I measured uptime, diesel savings, and emissions reduction compared to the baseline diesel-only configuration.

**Result:**

The system achieved 98.2% uptime and reduced diesel consumption by 64%. I presented the results to the Ministry of Energy and was invited to contribute to future rural electrification frameworks. My design has since been replicated in two other villages. This project demonstrated my ability to implement engineering solutions in constrained environments and to systematically evaluate performance against technical and sustainability benchmarks.
