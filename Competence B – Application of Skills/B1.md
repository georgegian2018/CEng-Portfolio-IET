### ✅ **Alternate B1 – Identifying and Defining Project Requirements, Problems, and Opportunities**

**Theme:** Digital Twin Integration in a Smart Campus

**Situation:**

In 2022, I was appointed as the lead Digital Systems Engineer for a smart campus development in Oman, which aimed to incorporate a digital twin environment for real-time energy, security, and occupancy management. The project brought together MEP, ICT, BIM, and facilities management teams, each with different definitions of scope and data ownership.

**Task:**

Over a six-month period, I was tasked with identifying and defining the requirements for integrating Building Management Systems (BMS), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and the digital twin platform. The challenge was resolving the inconsistencies between existing BIM data, real-time sensor streams, and client expectations for system automation.

**Action:**

I led a series of stakeholder workshops and technical discovery sessions to map existing systems and identify integration constraints. I developed a problem definition matrix highlighting overlaps, delays, and missing input parameters. This exposed a critical issue: the BIM files lacked metadata needed for real-time sensor binding.

I proposed a new tagging convention based on COBie (Construction-Operations Building information exchange) and facilitated workshops with the BIM team to retroactively enrich the data. I also reviewed the MQTT protocol options for live sensor streaming and presented a technical architecture for linking the data sources via middleware.

To mitigate scope creep, I authored a Functional Requirements Document (FRD) and aligned all stakeholders using a revised project scope validated against ISO 19650 (BIM framework).

**Result:**

The scope was finalised within 4 weeks, with 100% sign-off from all stakeholders. The digital twin integration proceeded smoothly, with no data compatibility issues. The enriched BIM files were adopted as a new internal standard, and the client recognised our team’s early problem definition work as a key reason for the project’s success. This experience strengthened my ability to lead the definition of engineering requirements across disciplines and align stakeholders through structured problem-solving.
