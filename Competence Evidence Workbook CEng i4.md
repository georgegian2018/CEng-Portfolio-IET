|    | A. Knowledge and understanding  Chartered Engineers shall use a combination of general and specialist engineering knowledge and understanding to optimise the application  of advanced and complex systems. This competence is about the ability to understand underpinning technical principles relevant to the applicant’s area of practice and applying them to develop technical solutions. This could involve technical solutions for novel problems or dealing with significant technical complexity. This may involve the integration of a range of technologies and consideration of other factors. This competence requires that an applicant is maintaining and developing their knowledge in their field of practice and not just that required for specific tasks. |                                                                                                                                                             |                         | PRA's comments on Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   |   |

|    | C. Responsibility, management and Leadership  Chartered Engineers shall demonstrate technical and commercial leadership. This competence is about the ability to plan the applicant’s own work and manage or specify the work of others effectively, efficiently, and in a way which provides leadership at an appropriate level, whether technical or commercial. Leadership is not necessarily about having a formal line management role. In matrix management and other types of organisational structure, where Chartered Engineers are working within complex and varied working relationships, they will provide leadership to achieve objectives.
